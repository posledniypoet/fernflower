I added two private methods: first for removing default constructors from record classes (I checked it by super class of our class, if our class super class is "java/lang/Record" and name of the method is "<init>" we hide this method). Getters I removed with the same logic: if class is record, and record have field with name of method and this method has only one local variable (that means it's empty method) then we hide this method. Also, I added in preferences flag "HIDE_RECORD_DEFAULT" (shorter - "hrd") and by default it has value "1" but if user want to see default methods in records it can be switched off.
